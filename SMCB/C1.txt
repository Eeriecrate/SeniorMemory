I am logic mixed with a hint of insanity. I am a grey shirt with blue jeans almost everyday. I am programming every day to improve not only my skills, but also my future. I am the friend of many and the foe of few. The chasm so vast and grand that only a few could ever truly illuminate it. I am the silent learned who never feels as bright as he wish he were. I am the lover of rice and anything grey. I am the Vice President of the TSA. The one who started with a love of red that slowly turned to grey. Molded by a sudden change and harsh realities. The lowly, unspoken, scared child to the confident business student. Yes, I am truly much more than my name entitles, but you can still call me so. I am Tanner Anthony McKamey, and I hope one day that I'm a big name to throw.

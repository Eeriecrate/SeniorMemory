While I can't remember 100% how this one is meant to go, I'll give it my best shot. Many events have lead to me being the person I am today, but I'll only list a few. Growing up I was a terrible kid, I once tried to basically kill my sister when I was 4 with a machette I found laying around. It wasn't anyone's fault that it was there, they were cutting kudzu that day. I was pretty bad for cursing, though I didn't do it a lot in front of my parents. There are many other things, but I'm not going to get into that. When I was 4, I moved in with my grandparents when they moved out of my mother's house which they had been staying in until they got their new house. Living with them, I had to learn a lot, when I was 8 I began to realize that my grandparent's were not in the best health, so I had to to try to take of them the best that I could. 

This really changed me, but when I was 14 my grandmother passed away, and my grandfather that same year. While this is the stem of my change, it is a dedication to my friend Courtney that makes me remain who I am today. Of course, I could never tell my friend about this reasoning. I want to be able to see her in the future, and I can't do that if I find myself stuck in the same situation as the rest of my family. I really don't think I could handle losing her. She's been there for me through everything since I've known her. She even came to my grandfather's funeral to try to keep me calm. I really do appreciate her.

I currently live with my mother, but honestly I don't feel the need to talk about it. For most5 of my life I lived with my grandfather, Kenneth and my grandmother, Betty. I moved in with them when I was 4, and I took care of them to my best ability as soon as I was old enough. The thing I did were never that huge, I guess helping with grocery shopping, cleaning, and generally watching over them. They changed who I was when I was young, and it was for the better. I was such a bad kid, but living with them I really began to feel as if my actions had a large impact on their emotions. It was because of any guilt that I felt that I changed into who I am today. I'm glad for it, even if it's not the best way to become a good person. My family tends to not be the best, but I feel that with my grandparent's help I can become something different than my family members. My grandparents were really good people, but that as far as I'm comfortable to go with that extension of praise with my family members.

Honestly, I find this topic a bit unsettling. It's bringing me to tears to think about some, but I feel it's best just to leave the past be. I don't want to feel this pain again. The ones I've lost have changed so much that I don't like to think about them as a friend. The ones who I've lost to death have been gone so long that I've already made my peace. I feel that to return and see again would ruin my thoughts of the past. I wouldn't risk the thoughts of joys, and the foolish euphoria that I gain from my recollections for a chance to feel the pain of loss once more. It's more than possible that I'm just being stubborn, but that doesn't change my inability to answer this question any further. It is for the reason I have to end this chapter here. Sorry.

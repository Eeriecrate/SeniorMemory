In 3rd grade, I switched from Ridgewood Elementary to Lake City Elementary. When I was there I was scared, since no one really wanted to be friends with the new kid in school. Thankfully I met Jacob Owens, who I became best friends with quickly. I began to make a lot of more friends after that point, but Jake was still the closest of them all. On the playground there was a balance beam that Jake and I would stand on and call eachother the "balance masters."

School always felit like it was full of factions, and it was rare that you spoke to anyone outside of your faction. I guess that's why even to this day I group certain sets of people together in my mind, even though most of us have changed so much. People chance and people depart, either they leave the school or they just leave. Though this sad reality still rests in life, there is always a brightside. I meet more and more new people, some of them stick. I'm still very close to Jake, spending a lot of my free time with he and Courtney. No single memory stands out, because nothing is yet complete.

Honestly, I can't think of any HUGE influences in my life. Everything seems subtle, more like a nudge in the right direction. For most any positive, there is always a negative that could come later on. With that being said, I'll begin my attempt to list the major turns in my life.
	I obviously can't go without listing my grandmother. Her kind nature made me always feel that I couldn't fail, but sometimes this had a negative effects. Grades for example. There was also my grandfather, he was always very kind to me and... well, it upsets me to think about him so I'll skip that.
	My Father is a big influence, he never believes in me and doesn't care about anything I do. He once told me that any idiot could learn to program a computer, this angered me and I learned to program just out of spite. I really do love programming, it's my passion. I really want to impress him, though. That will never change. I know it's impossible, though. When I told him I got a job as an intern for the ACCTC, he told me that he thought I should get a job where I don't sit around all day first so I learn to appreciate it. Literally telling me to go "dig a ditch."
